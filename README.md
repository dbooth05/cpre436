This is a quickly made React frontend and Springboot backend site for a cyber Security Class project.

This site was not explicitly designed to be a secure site. Instead this site's purpose was only
to serve in the scenario of a Photography class Photoshare site. With time, this site will
become secure. This is rather ironic for the purpose of class this was made for. 

### Scenario
You are a broke undergraduate student at Iowa State University studying Cyber Security with a plethora of minors 
you would like to achieve. For a fun class, you once took Photography 100, Intro to Photographic Studies, 
where you met a professor, Gladys “Granny” a tenured professor. 

Two years later, after completing the minor, Professor Gladys reaches out to you for assistance and an opportunity to 
buy a couple more dinners, and you decide to meet her. At this meeting she informs you that she believes students are 
cheating in her class and asks for your help. She believes that there is Academic Misconduct because of a 
drastic increase in grades on exams and homework since duplicate images have been uploaded to the class website. 
You are given access to the class website, used by the class to share photos, and are told about a rumored python script. 
She did not know what a python script was, but said she would get it to you. 

Your goal is to find evidence of Academic Misconduct and the possible culprits. You determine that there must be 
covert communication happening with the images. Upon finding evidence, you are asked to write a report about your findings.
